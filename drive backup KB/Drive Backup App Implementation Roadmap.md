# Drive Backup App Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap is planning-only. It does not prescribe exact code structure.

## Phase 0: Knowledge Base

Deliverables:

- product requirements;
- architecture;
- failure matrix;
- testing plan;
- source register;
- release workflow;
- AI context guide.

Exit gate:

- A future agent can start from [[Drive Backup App Index]] and retrieve only relevant notes.

## Phase 1: Android Project Setup

Load:

- [[Drive Backup App Project State]]
- [[Drive Backup App GitHub And Release Workflow]]
- [[Drive Backup App Testing Plan]]
- [[Drive Backup App Engineering Change Discipline]]

Deliverables:

- clean Android project;
- git repository;
- branch protection plan;
- signed debug/internal release process;
- CI or documented local build command.
- final app name, namespace, and application ID;
- root agent instructions;
- default template code replaced or cleaned up.

Exit gate:

- Empty app builds and tests run.
- Future agents can identify the repo root and knowledge base without guessing.
- Scaffold cleanup has checked Gradle, namespace, manifest, resources, tests, and docs as one change surface.

## Phase 1A: Android Foundation Decisions

Load:

- [[Drive Backup App Android Engineering Research]]
- [[Drive Backup App Project State]]
- [[Drive Backup App Architecture]]
- [[Drive Backup App Testing Plan]]
- [[Drive Backup App Source Register]]

Deliverables:

- final app name;
- final package/application ID;
- UI stack decision;
- dependency injection decision;
- persistence stack decision;
- package structure decision;
- build flavor decision;
- canonical local test commands;
- official-doc source check for build, architecture, and testing choices.

Recommended defaults:

- Kotlin.
- Jetpack Compose.
- Single Activity.
- Hilt.
- Room for sync ledger and sync history.
- DataStore for settings.
- WorkManager for durable background work.
- Single app module at first.
- Feature packages inside `app`.
- Distribution flavor dimension with `internal` and `public`.

Exit gate:

- Decisions are documented before feature code.
- The scaffold can be cleaned without re-arguing architecture in every later phase.

## Phase 2: Auth And Allowlist

Status: integrated into `main` through PR #2. Release-only manual cases remain
tracked in the Phase 2 plan and Testing Plan.

Load:

- [[Drive Backup App Product Requirements]]
- [[Drive Backup App Security Privacy And Access]]
- [[Drive Backup App Source Register]]

Deliverables:

- Google sign-in;
- allowed email gate;
- sign-out;
- blocked account UI;
- tests.

Exit gate:

- Approved account enters app; unapproved account cannot sync.

## Phase 3: Local Folder Selection

Status: the implemented folder-selection slices are integrated into `main`
through PR #4. Health classification and iterative read-only scanning remain
open. The adversarially reviewed execution contract is
[[Drive Backup App Phase 3 Local Folder Access Implementation Plan]].

Load:

- [[Drive Backup App Phase 3 Local Folder Access Implementation Plan]]
- [[Drive Backup App Product Requirements]]
- [[Drive Backup App Architecture]]
- [[Drive Backup App Source Register]]

Deliverables:

- Android folder picker;
- persisted folder permission;
- folder permission repair;
- mapping list UI;
- tests.

Exit gate:

- User-selected internal folder can be scanned after app restart.

## Phase 4: Downloads Source And Drive Destination Setup

Load:

- [[Drive Backup App Architecture]]
- [[Drive Backup App Security Privacy And Access]]
- [[Drive Backup App Source Register]]

Deliverables:

- first milestone: explicit opt-in exact top-level Downloads source using the
  Android all-files-access settings flow;
- read-only Downloads traversal, revocation detection, and Samsung acceptance,
  isolated from the default SAF source path;
- shared parent folder connection;
- per-user/per-device folder creation;
- Drive destination health check;
- ownership/quota spike result;
- tests.

Exit gate:

- App can enumerate exact top-level Downloads read only after explicit consent,
  and create a test file in the shared folder using the signed-in user's account.

## Phase 5: Sync Engine

Load:

- [[Drive Backup App Sync Semantics]]
- [[Drive Backup App Failure Matrix]]
- [[Drive Backup App Testing Plan]]

Deliverables:

- sync planner;
- local ledger;
- upload worker;
- resumable uploads;
- per-file result recording;
- tests.

Exit gate:

- One unreadable or failed file does not stop other uploads.

## Phase 6: Background And Manual Sync

Load:

- [[Drive Backup App Architecture]]
- [[Drive Backup App Sync Semantics]]
- [[Drive Backup App Source Register]]

Deliverables:

- manual sync;
- periodic sync;
- constraints;
- cancellation;
- progress observation;
- tests.

Exit gate:

- Manual sync works immediately; periodic sync is scheduled and observable.

## Phase 7: Email Notifications

Load:

- [[Drive Backup App Product Requirements]]
- [[Drive Backup App Security Privacy And Access]]
- [[Drive Backup App Failure Matrix]]
- [[Drive Backup App Source Register]]

Deliverables:

- email adapter;
- email summary builder;
- failed filenames included;
- email retry state;
- tests.

Exit gate:

- Sync completion attempts email and records email result without affecting sync result.

## Phase 8: Recovery And Diagnostics

Load:

- [[Drive Backup App Testing Plan]]
- [[Drive Backup App Sync Semantics]]
- [[Drive Backup App Failure Matrix]]

Deliverables:

- sync history;
- diagnostics export;
- recovery checklist;
- restore-readiness view.

Exit gate:

- User can inspect backup contents from laptop Drive and understand latest sync state.

## Phase 9: Release

Load:

- [[Drive Backup App GitHub And Release Workflow]]
- [[Drive Backup App Testing Plan]]

Deliverables:

- internal APK;
- public APK;
- release notes;
- rollback APK retained.

Exit gate:

- APK channel and GitHub visibility are verified before sharing.
