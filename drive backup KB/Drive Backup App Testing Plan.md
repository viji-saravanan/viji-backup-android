# Drive Backup App Testing Plan

Testing must prove that the app reduces data-loss risk instead of creating new silent failure modes.

## Testing Philosophy

No feature is tested properly if it only proves the happy path. Backup software must be tested against denial, interruption, corruption, quota exhaustion, cancellation, stale state, duplicate state, and recovery.

For every feature, define:

- the success path;
- at least one invalid-input case;
- at least one denied/revoked-permission case when permissions are involved;
- at least one retryable failure case;
- at least one permanent failure case;
- a persistence case after app restart or worker restart when state is stored;
- a cancellation case when work is long-running;
- a reporting case proving the UI/history/email surfaces the outcome correctly.

If the current test layer cannot cover a case, add it to the manual device matrix or recovery drill. Do not drop the case silently.

No fake phone, emulator, test double, synthetic DocumentsProvider, or fake cloud
response can be used as evidence that a physical-device, SAF, Google auth,
Google Drive, upload, or recovery acceptance gate passed. Deterministic tests
remain required for hostile branches that cannot be triggered safely against
personal data, but they are supporting evidence only. Every implemented external
boundary also needs the real physical-device/service case named by its phase.

## Test Layers

### Unit Tests

Cover pure logic:

- allowlist matching;
- folder mapping validation;
- relative path normalization;
- file identity comparison;
- sync planner decisions;
- deletion policy;
- conflict policy;
- retry classification;
- settings validation;
- effective settings snapshot creation;
- preflight result classification;
- preview estimate generation;
- completeness report generation;
- upload verification decision logic;
- email summary generation;
- privacy mode selection;
- Drive destination state classification.

Every unit-tested state machine should include invalid transition tests, not just valid transitions.

### Deterministic Integration Tests

Use controlled local trees, service test doubles, and instrumentation-only
providers to force failures that must not be inflicted on personal data.

Cover:

- first sync;
- incremental sync;
- changed file;
- deleted local file;
- unreadable file;
- duplicate remote file;
- network failure;
- mobile data disabled;
- mobile data enabled;
- mobile data file-size limit;
- dry-run preview does not mutate Drive;
- upload verification success and mismatch;
- Drive 401/403/429/5xx;
- quota exceeded;
- resumable upload restart;
- email failure;
- crash and resume from ledger.

Deterministic integration tests should simulate hostile service behavior:
duplicate responses, missing metadata, partial upload completion, stale Drive
IDs, repeated transient errors, and permanent denial after retries. Passing them
never replaces a real Drive or physical-device acceptance result.

### WorkManager Tests

Cover:

- manual one-time sync scheduling;
- unique periodic sync scheduling;
- no duplicate concurrent workers per mapping;
- retry/backoff behavior;
- cancellation;
- progress observation;
- constraints for network, mobile data policy, battery, charging, and storage.

Work tests must prove that duplicate workers do not corrupt state and that cancellation leaves completed file records intact.

### Instrumented Android Tests

Cover:

- Credential Manager adapter mapping with controlled results plus separate live
  approved-account sign-in on the physical device;
- folder picker result handling;
- persisted read-only URI permission with no persisted write permission;
- revoked URI permission;
- picker request correlation across process/activity recreation;
- Room mapping transaction and migration behavior;
- iterative DocumentsContract traversal, cancellation, and cursor closure;
- settings screen updates for frequency, mobile data, folders, charging, and email recipients;
- notification permission denied;
- preflight screen repair actions;
- backup health dashboard states;
- app restart with configured folder;
- sync progress UI;
- localized human-readable sizes, durations, rates, and timestamps without raw
  machine values in ordinary UI;
- sync history UI;
- diagnostics export;
- upgrade migration.

Instrumented tests should cover Android-specific permission and lifecycle behavior that unit tests cannot prove.

### Manual Device Tests

Run on at least:

- Android 11;
- Android 12/13;
- Android 14/15 or current target;
- one Pixel device or emulator;
- one Samsung device if available.

The connected Samsung physical baseline is mandatory for Phase 3 and later
acceptance. An emulator can broaden API coverage but cannot replace it.

Scenarios:

- battery saver on;
- screen off during sync;
- Wi-Fi only;
- metered network;
- mobile data allowed;
- mobile data blocked by setting;
- manual mobile data override;
- airplane mode during upload;
- device reboot;
- app force stop;
- Drive folder sharing removed;
- Google account removed from device;
- notification permission denied or revoked;
- app killed while a file is uploading;
- folder permission revoked after successful setup;
- Drive folder access removed after successful setup;
- account removed from device after successful setup;
- low storage condition where practical;
- repeated cancellation and retry.

Current physical baseline is Samsung Galaxy A23 (`SM-A236E`) on Android 14 / API
34 and One UI 6.1. On 2026-07-12, both internal and public flavors completed 28
instrumented tests with zero failures or errors. This device currently has about
1.5 GB free, so it is valid low-storage evidence but is not suitable for large
sync data sets until the owner frees space manually.

Do not record device serials or account addresses. Label real approved accounts
as A1-A4 and a deliberately excluded real account as B1 in test evidence.

## Phase 2 Authentication Evidence

Automated evidence current on 2026-07-12:

- 59 JVM tests per flavor cover exact policy matching, locale normalization,
  malformed configuration, session persistence ordering, stale callbacks,
  duplicate sign-in/sign-out, cancellation, retry classification,
  current-process approval retention, cold-process reauthentication,
  restart-resumable provider cleanup, and lifecycle request dispatch;
- 28 connected tests per flavor cover Credential Manager request construction
  and result mapping, malformed credentials, cancellation and fatal propagation,
  DataStore recreation/corruption/partial-state repair, Compose text/actions and
  protected-content denial, application-container stability, and real
  `MainActivity` fail-closed composition;
- both app APKs and both Android-test APKs assemble;
- both lint tasks pass with seven recorded version-currency warnings;
- the full source workload passes with all private configuration forced blank,
  which proves the clean-checkout `ConfigurationRequired` path;
- GitHub source verification injects no private identifiers and uploads no APK artifact.

Redacted live evidence:

- A1-A4 reached approved state on the configured internal flavor;
- B1 was blocked under a temporary local allowlist and normal configuration was restored;
- backing out of Google UI recovered without cached approval;
- an approved cached session now survives normal relaunch, process death,
  force-stop, reboot, and in-place APK replacement without automatically
  opening the Google account chooser;
- `Change account` is the explicit chooser entry point, while sign-out clears
  the cached session;
- Home, DocumentsUI, and activity recreation retained one approved in-process
  session without launching another Google chooser;
- sign-out cleared the local session;
- the user independently reported the configured live flow working;
- an A1 process-only log scan found no fatal, raw-email, JWT-shaped, or
  OAuth-client-ID-shaped matches.

Release-only auth cases not yet claimed as complete:

- public-flavor live Google sign-in and blocked-account flow;
- physical removal of an approved Google account while the process survives;
- unavailable or disabled Google Play services;
- airplane mode during the provider flow;
- rotation while Google provider UI is active;
- TalkBack, switch access, and extreme font-scale review on a compact viewport.

## Phase 3 Local Folder Evidence Contract

The implementation and exact matrix are owned by
[[Drive Backup App Phase 3 Local Folder Access Implementation Plan]]. Phase 3 is
not complete until the Samsung/API 34 proves all of the following with the real
system picker and real persisted grant:

- only read permission is retained;
- selected internal-storage data scans after force-stop/relaunch without another
  picker interaction;
- a real released grant becomes `PermissionMissing` while the mapping survives;
- repair restores the same mapping and same-URI repair does not revoke it;
- cancellation stops one scan without poisoning another mapping;
- a moved/deleted dedicated test tree does not delete its mapping automatically;
- one broken mapping does not stop another real mapping;
- installation-scoped mappings remain available to another configured approved
  identity;
- recent-apps preview hides protected folder metadata;
- a host-side before/after mutation-sentinel manifest proves the app did not
  alter dedicated test content;
- process logs and public evidence contain no raw URI, live filename, subject,
  token, OAuth identifier, or exception payload.

Focused evidence current on 2026-07-16:

- the canonical 179-task two-flavor unit, app APK, Android-test APK, and lint
  matrix passes after all closure changes with 115 JVM tests per flavor;
- the complete Android instrumentation package passes 160 tests per flavor on
  Samsung user 0; focused counts below identify the highest-risk closure slices
  within that complete pass;
- 58 focused repository, durable-cleanup-store, and app-context instrumentation
  cases pass on Android user 0, including file-backed restart recovery after
  forced Room mark-zero and mark-throwing failures;
- 11 Compose folder-screen cases pass on the Samsung, covering real/fallback
  labels, exact-ID forwarding, named confirmation, cancel-without-side-effect,
  in-flight progress, disabled competing actions, and non-sensitive notices;
- 5 app-composition cases pass on the Samsung, including real dynamic
  `ActivityResultRegistry` delivery after recreation and one-shot exact-token
  completion;
- ViewModel coverage proves complete, partial, failed, terminal-less, throwing,
  non-cooperative late-event, cancel-versus-complete, and concurrent
  failed/healthy behavior without cross-mapping state loss;
- the final redacted live probe confirms 3 named mappings, 3 persisted tree
  grants, 0 write grants, and no pending picker operation;
- a real 1,502-file scan traversed 5 folders with 0 unreadable entries; a second
  configured approved identity completed a separate 2-file scan with 0
  unreadable entries;
- exact duplicate selection was rejected, picker cancellation created no
  mapping, and controlled removal released app access before a clean re-add;
- an opt-in instrumentation-only control released exactly one grant selected by
  a display-name digest; only that mapping degraded, a healthy mapping remained
  usable, and same-tree repair restored the expected grant baseline;
- moving the dedicated tree produced a typed unavailable state after
  revalidation, repair followed the moved tree, and restoration returned to the
  original 3-mapping baseline;
- the dedicated 1,502-file content manifest remained identical after scan,
  revocation, repair, remove, re-add, move/repair, and restoration;
- the protected recent-apps card was blank, and the app-process log audit found
  zero email, content-URI, OAuth-client, JWT-shaped, UUID-shaped, or live-label
  matches;
- the exact Downloads root is visibly blocked by Android DocumentsUI as the
  official Android 11+ contract requires. This is not an app defect and must not
  be bypassed silently;
- the whole-branch review remains intentionally deferred as the final merge
  gate; it is not needed to repeat the completed live matrix.

Impossible-to-induce branches use a controllable instrumentation-only
DocumentsProvider through the production scanner. This is not live acceptance.
Crash-point tests terminate and restart the test process around real Room and URI
grant boundaries. Deferred API 24/API 30/API 36, removable-storage, reboot, and
cross-device-transfer cases stay visible until actual evidence exists.

## Phase 4 Session And Downloads Evidence

The exact contracts are owned by [[Drive Backup App Phase 4 Session Persistence
Implementation Plan]] and [[Drive Backup App Phase 4 Downloads Access
Implementation Plan]]. Evidence current on 2026-07-18:

- both-flavor unit, app APK, Android-test APK, and lint tasks pass after the
  session and Downloads changes;
- the physical Downloads Compose suite passes 5/5, and the auth-gate plus app-
  composition regression suite passes 16/16 on Samsung Android user 0;
- force-stop and relaunch of the public build opens the approved surface without
  a chooser, retains the configured Downloads source, and reports `Ready`;
- a visible real Downloads scan reaches `Scan complete` and reports `5.1 GB`
  through Android's localized short-size formatter; the same UI hierarchy
  contains no raw byte count, account, path, or filename;
- a live exact-root probe cancels and retries successfully, while a before/after
  aggregate metadata digest remains unchanged;
- real OS grant revocation produces `Access required` before any read and hides
  Scan; returning from Settings without granting remains blocked;
- restoring access returns `Ready`, and live disable/enable, remove, unused-
  grant classification, and reconfiguration preserve all phone content;
- deterministic scanner coverage includes empty, deep, wide, hidden, symlink,
  cycle, root-escape, unreadable, disappearing, overflow, cancellation, partial,
  throwing, and stale-event cases.

The Phase 4 Downloads milestone is closed. Physical API 24-29 fallback coverage,
another manufacturer's phone, removable storage, and OS-protected
`Android/data`/`Android/obb` locations remain compatibility/release matrix items;
they are not claimed as universally accessible. Google Drive upload has not
started and receives no acceptance credit from these tests.

## Phase 4 Drive Connection Evidence

The exact contract is owned by [[Drive Backup App Phase 4 Drive Authorization
And Destination Plan]]. Evidence current on 2026-07-18:

- both-flavor unit, app APK, Android-test APK, and lint tasks pass after Drive
  authorization, destination health, UI, and composition wiring;
- 19 focused Samsung user-0 instrumentation tests pass with zero failures: 5
  plain-language Drive UI cases, 4 Activity Result cases, 7 real-activity
  composition/lifecycle cases, 2 Google provider/request-shape cases, and 1
  installed network-permission case;
- deterministic tests cover direct authorization, resolution-required, missing
  token/scope, optional returned identity, account mismatch, duplicate/stale
  callbacks, silent-resolution suppression, malformed/oversized provider data,
  200 metadata variants, 401, typed 403 reason families, 404, 429, 5xx,
  transport failure, and cancellation propagation;
- explicit Connect on the installed public build traverses real Google Play
  services authorization and reaches `Ready` only after the exact configured
  folder reports list and add-child capability;
- force-stop and cold launch reuse the approved app session and Drive grant
  without opening Credential Manager, account selection, or consent;
- disabling both active phone network settings makes a real Refresh report the
  temporary-unavailable state; restoring the original settings and refreshing
  again returns the configured destination to `Ready`;
- scans of persistent app storage and app-process logcat find no common access-
  token, refresh-token, `Bearer`, or Google token-prefix markers.

Still required for full Drive exit acceptance: live user cancel/back, Editor
permission removal and restoration, Drive-grant revocation and repair, airplane
mode, interrupted consent, and the complete latest two-flavor connected-device
matrix. These remain explicit gaps, not assumed passes.

## Data Set Matrix

Create test folders with:

- zero-byte files;
- tiny text files;
- photos;
- videos;
- PDFs;
- nested folders;
- long filenames;
- unicode filenames if supported by test environment;
- duplicate names in different folders;
- large files;
- files changing during sync;
- files deleted during sync.

## Release Test Gate

Before any public APK release:

- Unit tests pass.
- Deterministic hostile-path integration tests pass.
- Work scheduling tests pass.
- Negative and edge-case tests for changed areas pass.
- At least one full manual sync test passes on a physical device using real local
  data, the real signed-in Google account, and the real shared Drive folder.
- Failure email includes failed filenames.
- Source register has been checked for any platform behavior changed by the release.
- APK is signed with the correct key.
- GitHub branch, tag, and release notes match the release channel.

## Recovery Drill

At least once before MVP release:

1. Configure app on a test device.
2. Sync a representative folder set.
3. Confirm files are visible in the shared Drive folder from a laptop browser.
4. Reset or uninstall/reinstall app.
5. Confirm backup contents are still accessible from Drive.
6. Reconnect app and verify it does not duplicate every file unnecessarily.
7. Mark recovery drill completed in the app and confirm the reminder clears.

## AI Testing Context Rule

Any future agent implementing a feature must add or update tests in the same turn. If tests are not possible, the agent must state why and update this plan or the relevant failure row.

Before marking a feature done, the agent must state which negative cases were tested and which remain manual/device-only.

Testing must follow the blast radius. If a code edit affects settings, sync semantics, background work, Drive uploads, auth, folder access, email, progress UI, history, or release behavior, tests must cover the affected downstream behavior, not only the directly edited class or file.
