# Drive Backup App Source Register

This register lists source-backed platform claims. Future agents must verify current official docs before implementation when behavior is critical.

## Android Sources

| Topic | Source | Checked | Claim Used In Plan |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Storage Access Framework folder selection | https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/documents-files | 2026-07-08 | App can use folder picker and persist access, but Android blocks some locations such as storage roots and sensitive Android folders on modern versions. |
| WorkManager periodic work | https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/persistent/getting-started/define-work | 2026-07-08 | Periodic work is suitable for deferrable background work but timing is not exact and has a minimum interval. |
| Data transfer background work | https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/data-transfer-options | 2026-07-08 | Long-running/user-visible transfers need careful background execution choice and user-visible behavior. |
| WorkManager progress observation | https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/persistent/how-to/observe | 2026-07-08 | Work progress can be observed and surfaced to UI. |
| Android Keystore | https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/keystore | 2026-07-08 | Token/secret protection should rely on Android-recommended secure storage patterns. |
| Foreground service types | https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required | 2026-07-08 | Long-running visible transfer behavior must account for foreground service type requirements if foreground services are used. |
| Notification runtime permission | https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/notifications/notification-permission | 2026-07-08 | Android notification permission affects user-visible progress and should be tested. |
| Android app data backup | https://developer.android.com/identity/data/backup | 2026-07-08 | App's own settings backup must be considered carefully and must not include secrets. |
| Android Studio installation | https://developer.android.com/studio/install | 2026-07-11 | A current supported Android Studio can build against a physical device without installing an emulator on a resource-constrained laptop. |
| Java versions in Android builds | https://developer.android.com/build/jdks | 2026-07-11 | Keep the Android Studio Gradle JDK and terminal `JAVA_HOME` aligned; this project uses Java 17 compatibility. |
| Android SDK environment variables | https://developer.android.com/tools/variables | 2026-07-11 | `ANDROID_HOME` identifies the SDK; SDK user state and AVD locations can be moved deliberately without copying another contributor's absolute paths. |
| Physical Android device setup | https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device | 2026-07-11 | Enable USB debugging, accept the laptop RSA key, verify `adb devices`, and use real-device testing before release. |
| AGP 9.2 compatibility | https://developer.android.com/build/releases/agp-9-2-0-release-notes | 2026-07-12 | AGP 9.2 supports through API 37 and documents Gradle 9.4.1 and JDK 17 as its baseline; Phase 2 remains on this tested tool pairing. |
| Android 17 SDK and behavior changes | https://developer.android.com/about/versions/17/setup-sdk | 2026-07-12 | API 37 adoption changes the compile/target baseline and requires an explicit upgrade and compatibility test pass instead of an incidental auth-phase bump. |
| AGP 9 built-in Kotlin | https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-built-in-kotlin | 2026-07-08 | AGP 9 enables built-in Kotlin support, so the app should not apply the old Kotlin Android plugin while built-in Kotlin is enabled. |
| Jetpack Compose setup | https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/setup-compose-dependencies-and-compiler | 2026-07-08 | Compose requires the Compose compiler Gradle plugin with Kotlin 2.x and Compose dependencies should use the Compose BOM. |
| Compose v2 test migration | https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/testing/migrate-v2 | 2026-07-11 | Compose v2 test rules use `StandardTestDispatcher`; explicitly synchronize queued composition work and use an explicit Android host when required. |
| Credential Manager Sign in with Google overview | https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/credential-manager-siwg | 2026-07-11 | Use Credential Manager for Android authentication; Google Drive data access is a separate authorization action. |
| Credential Manager Sign in with Google implementation | https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/credential-manager-siwg-implementation | 2026-07-11 | Implement an authorized-account auto-select path plus a persistent explicit chooser; both use a Web application OAuth client ID. |
| Credential Manager sign-out | https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/credentials/CredentialManager#clearCredentialState(androidx.credentials.ClearCredentialStateRequest) | 2026-07-10 | Explicit app sign-out should clear local app state and notify credential providers with `clearCredentialState`. |
| Google ID token credential | https://developers.google.com/identity/android-credential-manager/android/reference/com/google/android/libraries/identity/googleid/GoogleIdTokenCredential | 2026-07-11 | Google ID library 1.2 exposes token-parsed email and stable Google account ID; raw ID tokens must not be persisted or logged. |
| Google Identity Android release notes | https://developers.google.com/identity/android-credential-manager/releases | 2026-07-11 | Google ID library 1.2.0 distinguishes email from stable unique ID; tests must require both identity claims. |
| Google Play services client authentication | https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth | 2026-07-11 | Source builds on a different laptop normally have a different debug certificate SHA-1 and need matching Android OAuth client registration. |
| Google ID token validation | https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/verify-google-id-token | 2026-07-10 | A relying-party server must validate token signature, audience, issuer, and expiry before treating an ID token as a server-side security identity. |
| Google Android authorization client | https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/auth/api/identity/AuthorizationClient | 2026-07-10 | Request Google data scopes such as Drive separately from authentication and only when the feature needs them. |

## Source Maintenance Rules

- Add a source row before relying on a new platform behavior.
- Re-check sources when implementation starts, because Android and Google policies change.
- If a source claim is refuted by current docs, update the affected notes and record the correction in [[Drive Backup App Open Questions And Assumptions]].
