# Phase 4 Drive Authorization And Destination Plan

**Goal:** Authorize the currently approved Google account for Drive, verify that
the configured shared destination is a writable folder, and expose a precise
repairable health state without persisting Google tokens or exposing private
configuration.

**Architecture:** Sign-in remains the local app gate. A separate Google Play
services `AuthorizationClient` request is bound to the approved account and
requests Drive data access only when Drive is probed or connected. The returned
short-lived access token remains in memory for one request and is passed to a
small Drive REST adapter. Every later worker repeats silent authorization; if
Google requires user interaction, work stops with `NeedsAuthorization` instead
of launching consent from the background.

**Tech stack:** Kotlin, Coroutines, Google Play services Auth 21.5.0,
`AuthorizationClient`, Activity Result APIs, `HttpURLConnection`, structured
JSON parsing, Compose, JUnit, Android instrumentation, real Google Drive
acceptance on a physical phone.

## Scope Decision

The configured destination is an existing manually-created folder shared with
the signed-in user. `drive.file` alone cannot reliably access that fixed folder:
Google limits it to files created/opened by the app or explicitly shared with
the app through Google Picker or an equivalent app picker.

The personal fixed-destination build therefore requests:

```text
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
```

This is a restricted scope. Backup/sync is an officially qualifying use case,
but broader public distribution can require OAuth verification. Before a
general public release, reassess an app-created destination anchor or Google
Picker plus `drive.file`; do not silently weaken or broaden scope.

Runtime least privilege remains strict even with the broad Google grant:

- only the configured destination ID is queried or used as a parent;
- no Drive listing, search, sharing, delete, trash, or ownership API is exposed
  by this slice;
- no offline server access or authorization code is requested;
- no access token, refresh token, result intent, or response body is persisted
  or logged;
- sign-out hides Drive state but does not claim to revoke Google's server-side
  grant; an explicit disconnect/revoke action is a later user-facing decision.

## Account Binding

- Build the authorization request with the exact approved normalized account.
- Never use account-selection prompt mode during Drive authorization.
- Verify the returned account email; if a stable Google ID is present, verify it
  against the approved subject as well.
- Any mismatch is terminal and fail closed. Discard the token, expose no
  destination state, and require account repair.
- A local cached app session is not Drive authorization. Every Drive operation
  obtains a current token or returns `NeedsAuthorization`.

## State Contract

| State | Meaning | User action |
|---|---|---|
| `Inactive` | No approved local account is active. | Sign in |
| `Checking` | Silent authorization or destination check is running. | Wait or leave app |
| `NeedsAuthorization` | Scope is absent, expired, revoked, or needs Google UI. | Connect Drive |
| `AwaitingAuthorization` | Google consent/account-owned resolution is open. | Complete or cancel Google UI |
| `ConfigurationRequired` | Destination ID or Google authorization setup is absent/invalid. | Project owner repairs build/cloud setup |
| `AccountMismatch` | Authorization did not return the approved account. | Repair account; never continue |
| `DestinationMissingOrInaccessible` | Drive returns not found or intentionally hides an inaccessible folder. | Restore sharing or destination |
| `DestinationNotFolder` | Configured ID resolves to a non-folder file. | Repair configuration |
| `DestinationTrashed` | Folder exists but is trashed. | Restore or replace folder |
| `DestinationReadOnly` | User can see but cannot add children. | Grant Editor access |
| `TemporaryFailure` | Network, timeout, 429, or 5xx prevents a current answer. | Retry; do not erase setup |
| `Ready` | Current account can read the folder metadata and add children. | Continue setup or refresh |

Cancellation restores `NeedsAuthorization` or the last known non-authoritative
state. It never reports `Ready`. Late callbacks are matched to one request ID
and cannot overwrite a newer account, sign-out, retry, or destination result.

## Destination Probe Contract

Use `files.get` on only the configured ID with `supportsAllDrives=true` and an
explicit fields mask containing only:

```text
id,mimeType,trashed,capabilities(canAddChildren,canListChildren)
```

Classify:

- `200`: parse strictly; require folder MIME type, not trashed,
  `canListChildren=true`, and `canAddChildren=true`;
- `401`: current authorization is unusable; return `NeedsAuthorization`;
- `403`: distinguish rate/quota/transient reasons when safely available;
  otherwise return inaccessible/read-only without exposing server text;
- `404`: missing or inaccessible, because Drive can intentionally hide access;
- `429` and `5xx`: temporary and retryable;
- malformed success JSON, unexpected redirects, oversized bodies, and all other
  status codes: fail closed with a typed non-sensitive result.

Never include the folder ID, access token, account address, response body, or
Drive error message in UI, logs, exceptions, test names, commits, or PR output.

## Task 1: Configuration And Pure State

- [ ] Validate non-empty destination configuration without exposing its value.
- [ ] Add typed request, result, health, and UI states.
- [ ] Write RED tests for every transition, duplicate request, cancellation,
  stale callback, account change, sign-out, retry, and configuration failure.
- [ ] Commit configuration/domain state independently.

## Task 2: Google Authorization Adapter

- [ ] Add the pinned official Play services Auth dependency.
- [ ] Build an account-bound request for exactly the restricted Drive scope.
- [ ] Map already-authorized, resolution-required, cancelled, unavailable,
  malformed, missing-scope, missing-token, and account-mismatch outcomes.
- [ ] Launch the returned `PendingIntent` through Activity Result and correlate
  the callback across activity recreation.
- [ ] Prove tokens and result intents are never persisted or logged.
- [ ] Commit authorization independently.

## Task 3: Destination Health Adapter

- [ ] Add a bounded HTTPS transport with connect/read timeouts, response-size
  limit, no redirects, and cancellation-safe cleanup.
- [ ] Parse structured JSON and classify every status/metadata row above.
- [ ] Write RED tests for 200 variants, 401, 403 reasons, 404, 429, 5xx,
  malformed/oversized response, timeout, cancellation, and thrown transport.
- [ ] Ensure one failed check cannot change local folder or Downloads state.
- [ ] Commit destination health independently.

## Task 4: Protected UI And Composition

- [ ] Add a compact Drive section visible only for an approved local account.
- [ ] Expose Connect, Retry/Refresh, and precise non-sensitive state copy.
- [ ] Disable duplicate actions while a request or Google resolution is active.
- [ ] Deactivate on sign-out/account change and ignore retired callbacks.
- [ ] Add Compose and real `MainActivity` tests for all controls and lifecycle
  boundaries without rendering IDs, scopes, tokens, or server payloads.
- [ ] Commit presentation/composition independently.

## Task 5: Physical Live Acceptance

- [ ] First connect launches Google consent for the currently approved account.
- [ ] Cancel/back leaves `NeedsAuthorization` and exposes no destination claim.
- [ ] Grant reaches `Ready` against the real configured shared folder.
- [ ] Force-stop/relaunch silently restores current health without a chooser or
  consent screen when the grant remains valid.
- [ ] Remove Editor access: destination becomes inaccessible/read-only while all
  local mappings and Downloads configuration remain intact.
- [ ] Restore Editor access and recover with Retry.
- [ ] Revoke Google Drive grant and prove no request reaches Drive with a stale
  token; interactive repair succeeds.
- [ ] Exercise offline, airplane mode, and interrupted consent as temporary or
  authorization states, never success.
- [ ] Run both flavor unit/APK/Android-test APK/lint checks and physical
  instrumented tests on Android user 0.
- [ ] Record only redacted state/count evidence and push sequential commits.

## Exit Gate

- The approved account explicitly grants Drive access and the app proves the
  configured shared destination is a writable, listable, non-trashed folder.
- Ordinary relaunch performs a silent check when Google can satisfy it; no
  automatic consent UI opens.
- Denial, cancellation, account mismatch, revoked grant, removed sharing,
  network failure, and malformed responses never appear ready.
- No Google token or private account/folder identifier is persisted, logged,
  committed, or rendered.
- Only after this gate passes may the first controlled Drive create/upload probe
  and per-user/per-device destination creation become active.
