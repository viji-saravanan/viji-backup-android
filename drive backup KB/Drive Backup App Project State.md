# Drive Backup App Project State

## Workspace

```

Knowledge base:

```

## Current Implementation

Phase 1 foundation, Phase 2 authentication, the public-source workflow, and the
implemented Phase 3 local-folder slices are integrated on `main` through PRs
#1-#4. Their implementation packets, architecture, failure matrix, security
rules, source register, and physical-device acceptance matrix are committed
alongside the code. Remaining Phase 3 health and scan work must begin from a new
branch based on this integrated baseline.

Implemented Phase 2 slices:

- exact normalized account policy;
- typed, fail-closed cloud configuration with invalid-address and duplicate checks;
- approved-account session manager with persistence-before-unlock behavior;
- Preferences DataStore storage with malformed and partial-state recovery;
- durable provider-cleanup marker retried after cancellation or process restart;
- explicit cloud-backup and device-transfer exclusion for cached auth metadata;
- Credential Manager authorized-account and explicit-chooser flows;
- stable credential/error parsing and provider-state clearing;
- lifecycle-safe request dispatch with one-shot consumption and duplicate suppression;
- application-scoped manual dependency container;
- Compose auth gate, approved surface, progress, warnings, retry, and sign-out states;
- cold-process reauthentication with approval retained across Home, picker, and
  activity recreation while the same approved process remains alive;
- private build configuration loaded outside Git;
- internal and public debug flavors that coexist on one device;
- zero-secret GitHub source verification for unit, build, Android-test APK, and lint tasks;
- fresh-laptop setup and repeatable test runbook.

Implemented Phase 3 slices:

- Room schema 1 for unique folder mappings and one durable picker-operation slot;
- backup/transfer exclusion for the Room database and grant-dependent state;
- read-only `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE` contract with request-token correlation;
- exact persisted-read-grant acquisition, legacy write-grant reduction, orphan
  cleanup, cancellation propagation, and crash recovery;
- approved-only folder observation, add, exact-duplicate rejection, and repair;
- provider-derived root display names with existing-row backfill and safe generic
  fallback labels when metadata is unavailable;
- confirmed removal that revokes the grant before deleting the mapping, remains
  retryable on grant or Room failure, and never deletes phone or Drive content;
- generation-owned removal presentation that prevents a cancelled older
  operation from clearing progress or publishing an outcome for a newer one;
- compact Compose folder rows with named remove confirmation, progress, notices,
  and disabled competing mutations;
- process-scope auth regression coverage proving Home, picker round trips, and
  activity recreation do not repeatedly invoke Google sign-in.
- sign-out compensation that serializes and retries pending picker cleanup
  before local auth state is cleared, without blocking sign-out on one cleanup
  failure;
- per-launch picker callback identity that discards a retired pre-sign-out
  result without consuming a post-sign-in replacement, including activity
  recreation.

Not yet implemented after the integrated Phase 3 slices:

- live root health classification and permission-loss repair state;
- iterative metadata scan, scan progress, cancellation, and per-mapping isolation;
- enable/disable controls and scan controls;
- Google Drive authorization or destination access;
- any selected-folder sync behavior;
- release signing or APK publication.

## Confirmed Cloud Setup State

Personal identifiers and cloud resource IDs are private configuration even when
they are not authentication secrets. They must not appear in tracked files or
Git history. Real values are held in ignored local configuration. Source CI
deliberately receives none of those values.

Allowed Google account roles:

- two project-owner identities;
- two primary-user identities;
- no other approved identities.

Drive destination:

- Parent folder: `My Drive > Viji > BACKUP`
- Upload folder: `My Drive > Viji > BACKUP > Viji Phone Uploads`
- Parent and upload folder IDs are private build/deployment configuration.
- Upload folder owner is the project-owner Google account.

Manual Drive access tests passed for both primary-user identities and the
alternate owner identity. Each tested account could open the upload folder,
create a test folder, upload a test file, and delete its own test file.

Separate Android OAuth debug clients exist for
`com.aryasubramani.vijibackup.internal` and
`com.aryasubramani.vijibackup`. A Web application OAuth client is configured
separately for Credential Manager. Their IDs are private configuration and are
intentionally omitted here. The configured internal mapping produced a working
live Google chooser and approved-account result on the physical baseline.

Email notification defaults:

- Sender: project-owner account, configured in the server-side relay.
- Recipients: project owner and primary user, configured in the server-side relay.
- Preferred method: Google Apps Script `MailApp` relay owned by Arya.

## Current Gaps And Boundaries

- Integrated development baseline is `main`. New implementation work must use a
  dedicated branch and PR; do not push directly to `main`.
- Git account switcher profiles are verified for `callmearya` and
  `viji-saravanan`; both commit with their GitHub-provided `noreply` identity.
- Current workflow intentionally splits commits between Arya personal and Viji.
  Never commit from Arya work.
- Client-side email allowlisting is a convenience gate in an untampered build,
  not an authoritative authorization boundary. A public APK exposes compiled
  identifiers and can be modified. Phase 4 and every future sync operation must
  enforce current Google authorization and Drive destination ACL access.
- Email-address allowlisting retains a subject-reassignment residual. Move to
  opaque Google subjects or a trusted verifier before claiming strong public
  authorization.
- The source/review repository became public on 2026-07-13 after the completed
  tracked-source and reachable-history privacy checks. Treat every branch, pull
  request, review, and workflow log as public. Internal APKs and privately
  configured artifacts still require a separate private release surface.
- Existing sequential commit authorship is preserved on the public branches.
  Stack integration uses merge commits rather than squashing so the default
  branch retains each phase's contributor metadata and review boundary.
- GitHub source CI intentionally receives no private values and must never upload
  privately configured debug APKs as artifacts.
- The project owner currently keeps an ignored, mode-`0600` `.env` as a
  temporary local vault for the three downloaded OAuth credential bundles and
  related private configuration. It is not loaded by Gradle, not available to
  contributors or CI, and not considered a disaster-recovery copy.
- `validatePublicReleasePrivacy` blocks `publicRelease` whenever the email
  allowlist or Drive folder ID is populated. A configured `publicDebug` is a
  private test artifact and must not be distributed.
- No signing/release setup exists.
- Manual live cases still needing explicit recorded evidence before release are:
  public-flavor Google sign-in, account removal on the physical device,
  unavailable Play services, airplane mode, and rotation while provider UI is
  open. Their fail-closed logic has automated coverage where possible, but
  automation is not a substitute for those release checks.
- The physical test phone has about 1.5 GB free and is 99% used. Never delete
  user data automatically; treat low storage as an explicit test and operational risk.
- Lint reports seven version-currency warnings. API 36.1, AGP 9.2.1, Gradle
  9.4.1, and the tested dependency set remain pinned for Phase 2. Android 17/API
  37 behavior adoption requires its own upgrade and device matrix instead of
  being folded into an auth review.

## Physical Device Baseline

Connected wired-ADB target:

- Samsung Galaxy A23 (`SM-A236E`);
- Android 14 / API 34;
- One UI 6.1;
- security patch `2026-05-05`;
- Google Play services `26.24.34`;
- device serial and account addresses intentionally excluded from evidence.

Observed on 2026-07-11, with the ADB connection reverified on 2026-07-13:

- internal flavor: 28 instrumented tests, 0 failures, 0 errors;
- public flavor: 28 instrumented tests, 0 failures, 0 errors;
- each flavor: 59 JVM unit tests, 0 failures, 0 errors;
- both package IDs install and launch side by side;
- DataStore partial/corrupt state, application-container wiring, Compose gate,
  Credential Manager mapping, and flavor identity pass on the Samsung;
- redacted live internal matrix: A1-A4 approved, B1 blocked under a temporary
  local allowlist, cancellation recovered, A1 restart reauthenticated, and
  sign-out cleared the local session;
- the user independently reported the configured live flow working;
- launched A1 process logs contained zero fatal, raw-email, JWT-shaped, or
  OAuth-client-ID-shaped matches;
- the missing-Web-client path returns `ConfigurationRequired` before credential UI;
- Gradle emits a non-fatal `androidx.test.services` app-ops warning before
  connected tests; accept it only when every test starts, finishes, and reports
  zero failures.

Additional Phase 3 lifecycle evidence on 2026-07-15:

- the review-discovered sign-out, recreation, re-sign-in, replacement-picker,
  and late-old-result sequence was witnessed failing before the fix;
- the focused 7-test state/composition suite and related 58-test repository,
  state, composition, and auth UI suite passed directly on Samsung user 0;
- both-flavor JVM tests, app and Android-test APK assembly, and lint passed.

## Current Passing Checks

```bash
./gradlew \
  :app:testInternalDebugUnitTest \
  :app:testPublicDebugUnitTest \
  :app:assembleInternalDebug \
  :app:assemblePublicDebug \
  :app:assembleInternalDebugAndroidTest \
  :app:assemblePublicDebugAndroidTest \
  :app:lintInternalDebug \
  :app:lintPublicDebug

./gradlew \
  :app:connectedInternalDebugAndroidTest \
  :app:connectedPublicDebugAndroidTest
```

The same source workload passes with every private build property forced blank,
proving a clean checkout reaches the intended fail-closed setup state.

## Immediate Goal

Complete Phase 3 health and read-only metadata scanning without weakening the
tested process-scope auth boundary or claiming that Android's local-only picker
hint proves physical locality.

Next sequence:

- finish live backfill acceptance for the two existing real mappings;
- record one explicitly chosen live removal/re-add case without touching the
  other mapping;
- implement health, read-only scan, cancellation, and per-mapping isolation in
  red-green vertical slices without mutating source content;
- run the full automated regression and every physical Samsung
  `FOLDER-LIVE-*` acceptance case;
- keep configured APKs and raw live evidence out of public CI and Git;
- defer real Drive authorization and upload acceptance to Phase 4, where the
  current Google account and shared-folder ACL must be checked.
