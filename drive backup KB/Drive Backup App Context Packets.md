# Drive Backup App Context Packets

This is the machine-friendly context manifest. Load [[Drive Backup App Index]] first, then use this note to choose exact packets.

For any implementation or file edit, also load [[Drive Backup App Engineering Change Discipline]]. Packet-specific notes explain what to build; the change-discipline note explains how to prove the edit did not break adjacent contracts.

## Global Implementation Exit Checks

Apply these to every implementation packet:

- The touched files' callers, dependencies, configuration, manifest/resource impact, persistence impact, tests, and docs have been checked where relevant.

## Global Final Check For Any Implementation Work

Before ending an implementation turn, a future agent must answer:

- Did the change preserve the failure isolation invariant?
- Did the change add or update relevant tests?
- Did the tests cover negative, edge, interruption, cancellation, and persistence behavior where relevant?
- Did the change avoid secrets in code, docs, logs, and APKs?
- Did the change update docs if behavior changed?
- Did the change rely on a platform claim that needs source verification?
- Which official docs were checked for platform behavior touched by this change?
