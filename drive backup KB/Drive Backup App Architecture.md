# Drive Backup App Architecture

## System Shape

The app is a native Android app. The app has no paid backend in MVP. It talks directly to Google services using the signed-in user's Google account and sends email through a free notification adapter.

## Major Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Auth and Allowlist | Credential Manager sign-in, stable subject/email extraction, process-scope local gate, cold-process reauthentication, sign-out |
| Folder Access | Android folder picker, persisted URI permissions, permission repair |
| Drive Destination | Shared folder connection, Drive folder ID storage, destination health checks |
| Sync Planner | Compare local folder state with local ledger and Drive state |
| Upload Worker | Upload files, resume uploads, record per-file results |
| Progress Store | Durable progress and status read by UI |
| Sync History | Immutable run records and exportable diagnostics |
| Email Adapter | Build and send completion summaries |
| Settings | Folder mappings, sync constraints, email recipients, privacy mode |
| Release Diagnostics | Build version, account, permissions, Drive destination, recent errors |

## Drive Destination Model

Arya creates one shared parent folder in Google Drive and shares it with approved user accounts as Editor. The user signs into the app with their own Google account and authorizes the app to write into that shared folder.

Preferred Drive structure:

```text
Arya Shared Backup Folder/
  <approved-user>/
    Device-Name-InstallId/
      Folder Mapping A/
      Folder Mapping B/
```

The app should store stable Drive file IDs for folders and files when available. Path strings alone are not enough because names can collide or move.

## Android Folder Access Model

Use Android's folder picker for local folders. The app only supports folders that Android allows the user to grant. If Android blocks a folder, the app must explain that the folder cannot be backed up directly.

On Android 11 and newer, the SAF picker blocks the exact Downloads root even
though it can allow a user-created subfolder beneath Downloads. Whole-Downloads
coverage is mandatory for the final app and requires a separate, explicit
all-files-access adapter after the SAF completion slice. It is not an extension
of the existing picker and must have independent consent, revocation, and
read-only tests.

The app should persist granted URI permissions and detect when a permission is lost, revoked, or no longer points to readable content.

Phase 3 narrows this model further:

- request a local-only SAF tree without broad storage permissions;
- persist read access only and remove any persisted write capability;
- treat provider IDs as opaque capabilities, never filesystem paths;
- store mappings in Room and derive current access health from Android grants
  plus a live root query;
- use direct, iterative `DocumentsContract` traversal on an injected IO
  dispatcher with cancellation signals;
- serialize Room/grant compensation so process death cannot release a referenced
  grant or retain an unexplained orphan;
- hide all folder metadata outside an approved auth state and in recent-apps
  snapshots.

`EXTRA_LOCAL_ONLY` is a provider hint, not proof of physical locality. The
enforceable source contract is a user-selected SAF tree. Known internal-storage
trees are proven on the physical device; upload later requires renewed consent.

## Background Work Model

Use WorkManager for periodic and retryable background sync. Use one-time work for manual sync and unique periodic work for scheduled sync. Manual sync should be able to run as user-initiated work with visible progress.

Do not promise exact periodic timing. WorkManager periodic execution is approximate and subject to Android power management.

## Local State Model

Durable local state should hold:

- approved account metadata needed to request reauthentication, never a durable
  assertion that the current session is authorized;
- selected local folder mappings;
- Drive destination folder IDs;
- file ledger entries;
- active sync run state;
- per-file sync events;
- retry state;
- email notification state.

The exact schema belongs in implementation planning, but the data must support idempotent sync, crash recovery, and diagnostics.

Phase 2 uses a small application-scoped manual container and Preferences
DataStore for account subject, normalized email, and optional display name.
Cached metadata always enters `ReauthenticationRequired`; future workers must
independently prove current Google/Drive authorization and cannot trust this metadata.

Phase 3 adds Room database `viji_backup.db` for installation-scoped local folder
mappings and one durable picker-operation slot. Approved identities configured
for that installation are co-administrators of those mappings. Before unrelated
people share one Android user profile, the data model must add explicit profile
ownership. DataStore remains reserved for small scalar settings.

## Email Model

Email is a notification adapter, not part of sync correctness. A sync can succeed even if the email fails. Email failures are recorded and retried separately.

Preferred MVP option: Google Apps Script MailApp web app or another free adapter controlled by Arya. SMTP is a fallback, not the preferred design.

## Security Boundaries

- No Arya Google token on user devices.
- No Drive service account secret inside the APK.
- No OAuth refresh tokens in logs.
- No email credentials in source control.
- No private GitHub token inside APK.
- Signed APKs only.
- The local allowlist is not authoritative authorization in a public or modified
  APK; current Google authorization and Drive destination ACLs fail closed at
  every protected operation.

## Known Platform Caveat

If the shared destination is a normal My Drive folder owned by Arya, files uploaded by another user may be owned by that uploading user even when placed in Arya's folder. Validate ownership and quota behavior in an early spike.
