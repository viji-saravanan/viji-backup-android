# Phase 4 Downloads Access Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use
> `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` or `superpowers:executing-plans` and
> complete each production change with a red-green test cycle.

**Goal:** Let the user configure, health-check, recursively enumerate, cancel,
repair, disable, and remove the exact primary-storage `Downloads` source without
changing any source file.

**Architecture:** Android 11+ uses one dedicated `downloadsaccess` feature and
the package-specific all-files-access settings flow. It is a singleton source
with its own Preferences DataStore, permission gateway, direct read-only
scanner, ViewModel, and UI; it never enters the SAF/Room repository. Android 10
and earlier continue to use the existing system tree picker, where the exact
Downloads root is not platform-blocked.

**Tech stack:** Kotlin, Coroutines, Preferences DataStore, Android
`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`, `Environment`, `Settings`, Compose, JUnit, Android
instrumentation, physical Samsung acceptance.

## Decision And Alternatives

Use a parallel direct-path singleton.

- A unified typed source migration would immediately touch Room schema 1, the
  large compensation repository, every Phase 3 mapping test, and future upload
  contracts. That is unnecessary for proving one fixed system source.
- `MediaStore.Downloads` does not guarantee complete recursive coverage of
  arbitrary and unindexed files, so it cannot satisfy exact whole-Downloads.
- `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is justified because backup/restore is an Android-
  documented broad-access use case and Android 11+ explicitly blocks the exact
  Downloads root in `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`.

The permission technically grants read and write access across shared storage.
The app therefore enforces read-only behavior structurally: production
interfaces expose only health checks, metadata reads, and input streams; no
write, rename, move, create, or delete operation exists.

## Fixed Product Decisions

- Scope is the primary shared-storage `Downloads` directory only. Removable SD
  card and OTG roots remain separate future sources.
- API 30+ uses the dedicated special-access path. API 24-29 uses the existing
  SAF tree selection because the root restriction begins at API 30.
- The source recursively includes hidden files and folders when readable.
- Symbolic links are not followed. Escapes outside the normalized Downloads root
  are rejected.
- One unreadable entry increments a failure count and does not stop siblings.
- The source configuration is installation-scoped and shared by the mutually
  trusted approved co-administrator accounts, like Phase 3 mappings.
- Sign-out hides the source but does not delete its configuration or alter the
  Android permission.
- Disable stops future scans/sync while retaining configuration.
- Remove clears local source configuration and scan state but never removes or
  modifies phone files. If Android broad access remains granted, the app shows
  `Access granted but unused` with a direct system-settings revoke action.
- Revocation never removes the source silently. It becomes `Needs access` and
  offers repair.

## State Contract

Access health is independent from scan state and future backup health.

| State | Meaning | Allowed action |
|---|---|---|
| `NotConfigured` | Downloads is not a backup source and no unused broad grant exists. | Add Downloads |
| `PermissionGrantedButUnused` | Android broad access exists but local source configuration was removed. | Configure or revoke access |
| `NeedsPermission` | Source remains configured but Android access is absent. | Repair access or remove |
| `StorageUnavailable` | Permission exists but primary shared storage/root is unavailable. | Retry after storage returns |
| `Disabled` | Source is configured but excluded from automatic backup. | Enable or remove |
| `Ready` | Configured, enabled, granted, mounted, readable exact root. | Scan, disable, remove |

Scan state is one of `Idle`, `Scanning(progress)`, `Cancelling`, or terminal
`Completed`, `Partial`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`. A generation token prevents late
events from an old scan overwriting disable, revoke, remove, sign-out, or retry.

## Task 1: Permission, Configuration, And Health

**Create:**

- `app/src/main/java/com/aryasubramani/vijibackup/downloadsaccess/domain/DownloadsAccess.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/aryasubramani/vijibackup/downloadsaccess/data/DownloadsSourceStore.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/aryasubramani/vijibackup/downloadsaccess/data/DataStoreDownloadsSourceStore.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/aryasubramani/vijibackup/downloadsaccess/platform/AndroidDownloadsAccessGateway.kt`
- matching unit and Android instrumented tests under the same package paths.

**Modify:** `AndroidManifest.xml`, both backup-rule XML files, `AppContainer.kt`.

- [x] Write failing tests for every state-table transition, API 29/30 boundary,
  package-specific settings intent, unresolved-intent fallback, storage
  unavailability, permission revocation, persistence failure, and cancellation.
- [x] Implement the manifest permission, app-private configuration store,
  gateway, root provider, and repository with no file mutation API.
- [x] Prove DataStore recreation and exclusion from backup/device transfer.
- [x] Run focused tests and both-flavor unit/build/lint checks.
- [x] Commit permission/configuration independently.

## Task 2: Settings Result And Protected UI

**Create:**

- `downloadsaccess/presentation/DownloadsAccessViewModel.kt`
- `downloadsaccess/presentation/DownloadsAccessScreen.kt`
- their unit and Compose instrumented tests.

**Modify:** `MainActivity.kt`, `VijiBackupApp.kt`, `strings.xml`, composition tests.

- [x] Write failing tests for add, deny/back, grant, external revoke, repair,
  disable/enable, remove, unused grant, duplicate settings launch, activity
  recreation, sign-out hiding, and approved-account switching.
- [x] Emit one-shot settings requests from the ViewModel and use an Activity
  Result launcher plus `onStart` refresh; never trust the settings result code.
- [x] Render Downloads as a distinct source and keep `Access ready` separate
  from `Never backed up`.
- [x] Run both-flavor unit and Compose suites on Android user 0.
- [x] Commit UI/orchestration independently.

## Task 3: Read-Only Recursive Scanner

**Create:**

- `downloadsaccess/domain/DownloadsScanner.kt`
- `downloadsaccess/platform/IterativeDownloadsScanner.kt`
- focused JVM/instrumented scanner and ViewModel race tests.

- [x] Write failing tests for empty/deep/wide trees, hidden entries, symlinks,
  loops, root escape, unreadable root/child, disappearing/changing entries,
  cancellation at every boundary, overflow-safe counts, and late callbacks.
- [x] Implement an iterative non-following traversal on an injected IO
  dispatcher. Recheck broad access and root containment immediately before open.
- [x] Continue siblings after per-entry failures and emit only aggregate,
  non-sensitive progress.
- [x] Prove before/after source sentinels are identical.
- [x] Commit scanner/orchestration independently.

## Task 4: Physical Samsung Acceptance

- [x] Deny/back: no source, no scan, no ready claim.
- [x] Grant: exact primary Downloads becomes `Ready`; SAF mappings are unchanged.
- [x] Scan real Downloads: aggregate completion only; no filenames or paths in
  logs/evidence.
- [x] Cancel a sufficiently large scan and retry successfully.
- [x] Revoke externally, return, and prove `Needs access` before any scan.
- [x] Repair, disable/enable, remove, and reconfigure.
- [x] Force-stop/relaunch and in-place upgrade preserve configuration and classify
  the current OS grant correctly.
- [x] Compare complete content sentinels before/after every case; mismatch count
  must be zero.
- [x] Repeat automated coverage for both flavors and record package-specific
  grants separately.

## Completion Evidence

Closed on 2026-07-18 against a physical Samsung on Android 14, Android user 0.
Evidence excludes account addresses, device serials, paths, and filenames.

- The canonical two-flavor unit, app APK, Android-test APK, and lint matrix
  passes after the final scanner implementation.
- The unlocked-device Downloads Compose suite passes 5/5 with zero failures.
- The auth-gate and real app-composition regression suite passes 16/16 with zero
  failures on the same device.
- A production public build survives force-stop and in-place replacement,
  reopens without a Google chooser, reports Downloads `Ready`, and completes a
  real visible scan. A fresh user-driven scan on the same physical build reports
  `5.1 GB` through Android's localized short-size formatter and exposes no raw
  byte count.
- A live exact-root instrumentation probe cancels, retries to a terminal result,
  and produces an identical before/after aggregate metadata sentinel.
- With the real OS grant revoked, a live probe fails closed before any
  Downloads read. The visible app shows `Access required`, exposes no Scan
  action, and remains blocked after returning from Settings without granting.
- Restoring the OS grant returns `Ready`; disable/enable, confirmed remove,
  unused-grant classification, and reconfiguration all pass through the visible
  public app without touching source content.
- Scanner tests cover deep and wide trees, hidden entries, symlinks, cycle and
  root-escape defense, unreadable and disappearing entries, overflow,
  cancellation, retry, partial completion, and stale terminal events.

## Exit Gate

- The physical Samsung enumerates the exact primary top-level Downloads tree
  only after explicit special-access consent.
- Denial and revocation never appear protected.
- No app path can mutate Downloads content.
- One unreadable entry and cancellation remain isolated and retryable.
- Existing SAF mapping behavior and grants remain unchanged.
- Only after this gate passes may Phase 4 Drive authorization become the active
  implementation slice.
